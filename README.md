# Music-reactive-LEDs-using-Raspberry-Pi
A bunch of LEDs programmed using Raspberry to light up according to music tones and beats. Follow the steps below to do the project yourself.
  1) Connect the circuit as shown below

  2) Make you have the following Python dependencies - numpy, pyaudio, wave, math, Rpi, scipy
  3) Save the music file in WAVE format in the same folder as the main code.
  4) Connect your earphone/speaker to the raspberry pi.
  5) Now run the main code.
  
  Here is a demo of the project

  The project is implemented using python. It essentially works by sensing the audio amplitude from wave file and lighting up LEDs proportionate to the audio level.
  
  Electrical Components required - Raspberry Pi Board, Female to Male Connectors, Bread board, Speaker/Audio Output Device, 12 x LEDs, 12 x 330 Ohm Resistors
